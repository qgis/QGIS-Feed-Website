## 🧑💻 Development

For development purposes only, you can run this application in debug mode with docker compose. Some of the docker compose commands are already configured in the Makefile.

## 🏃Before you start

This project requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run the development and production environments.
Please ensure both are installed on your system before proceeding.

![Docker logo](https://www.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moby-logo.png)

You can check your installation with:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## 🛒 Getting the Code

- Clone git repo `git clone https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Feed-Website.git`
- Run `$ pwd` in order to get your current directory
- Path to your repo should be `<your current directory>/QGIS-Feed-Website `
- Go to dockerize directory `cd QGIS-Feed-Website`

## Pre-commit hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automate code quality checks before each commit. To set it up:

1. Install pre-commit (if not already installed):
    ```sh
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
    ```sh
    pre-commit install
    ```

Now, the configured checks (such as linting and formatting) will run automatically when you commit changes.

### ❄️ Nix

For Nix/NixOS users, you can run the following command on this project root folder:

```sh
nix-shell
./vscode.sh
```
TODO: Install all dependecies when running nix-shell.

### ⚡️ Quick Start
- Build the docker the container
```bash
$ make dev-build
```

#### Environment setup
- Create `settings_local.py` int the `qgisfeedproject` directory, configure the media folder as in the example below:

```python
# Settings local for docker compose production settings
import os

MEDIA_ROOT = '/shared-volume/media/'
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
STATIC_ROOT = '/shared-volume/static/'
STATIC_URL = '/static/'


if not os.path.exists(MEDIA_ROOT):
    os.mkdir(MEDIA_ROOT)

if not os.path.exists(STATIC_ROOT):
    os.mkdir(STATIC_ROOT)
```

- Generate the `.env` from `env.template` and edit it with your email variables:
```sh
cp env.template .env
nano .env
```
Don't forget to specify the QGISFEED_MEDIA_VOLUME with your media directory

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/email/#module-django.core.mail for further email configuration.

- To prevent DDOS attacks there is limit in the number of returned records (defaults to 20): it can be configured by overriding the settings in `settings_local.py` with:

```python
QGISFEED_MAX_RECORDS=40  # default value is 20
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: For new Django variables, please use the `settings_local_override.py` as the `.env` file is not supported by the new production infrastructure.

#### Django Local Settings Override (`settings_local_override.py`)

- Create settings_local_override.py file
```bash
$ cp settings_local_override.py.templ settings_local_override.py
```

- Edit settings_local_override.py file and set your environment variables

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: As we are migrating to a declarative based infrastructure, it is preferable to use the `settings_local_override.py` file for all new Django variables. This file is ignored when commiting so please make sure you define your new variables with an example value (**NOT THE REAL ONE FOR SECRETS AND PASSWORDS**) inside the `settings_local_override.py.templ` file.

#### Where each setting comes from

The application reads its configuration from two places, and it helps to know
which one owns a given setting.

The **environment** owns anything that changes between a laptop, the docker
stack and production, and that is not a secret. `settings.py` reads these:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `DEBUG` | `True` | Turn it off anywhere you would not want a stack trace on screen. |
| `DOMAIN_NAME` | empty | Public hostnames, comma separated. `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` is derived from it. |
| `QGIS_FEED_PROD_URL` | empty | The older name for the same thing, still read as a fallback. |
| `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT` | `qgisfeed`, `qgisfeed`, empty, `/var/run/postgresql`, `5432` | The database connection. The `QGISFEED_DOCKER_*` names still work as fallbacks. |
| `STATIC_ROOT` | `qgisfeedproject/static_collected` | Where `collectstatic` writes. |
| `MEDIA_ROOT` | `qgisfeedproject/media` | Where uploads are kept. |
| `GEOIP_PATH` | `/var/opt/maxmind/` | The directory holding `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`. |
| `GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH`, `GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH` | unset | Explicit paths to libgdal and libgeos. Leave them unset unless the usual library search fails. |

The default database host is a path, which libpq reads as a unix socket
directory. That suits a local PostgreSQL, so the compose files pass a hostname
of their own.

**`settings_local_override.py`** owns the secrets and the handful of settings
that have no environment variable. It is applied last, so anything you name in
it wins over the environment, including an empty string. Only list the settings
you mean to set. See `settings_local_override.py.templ` for the full list.

`SECRET_KEY` deserves a note. The value in `settings.py` is committed, so it is
public, and anyone can forge a session or a password reset token against a site
still using it. It is named `INSECURE_DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY` so a deployment can
compare `SECRET_KEY` against it and refuse to start. Django's own deployment
check will not catch this for you, because the committed key is long and varied
enough to pass `security.W009`.

#### Spin up the development environment

- Start the docker the container
```bash
$ make dev-start
```

- Run migrations:
```bash
$ make dev-migrate
```

- Create an admin user and set a password:
```bash
$ make dev-createsuperuser
```

- Show the development server logs:
```bash
$ make dev-logs
```


A set of test data will be automatically loaded and the application will be available at http://localhost:8000

To enter the control panel http://localhost:8000/admin, two test users are available:

- Super Admin: the credentials are `admin`/`admin`
- Staff (News Entry Author): the credentials are `staff`/`staff`

## 🧪 Running Django Unit Tests
<details>
    <summary><strong>🧪 Run all tests</strong></summary>
        </br>

To run all tests cases in the qgisfeed app, from the main directory:
```sh
$ make dev-runtests
```
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>🧪 Run a specific test</strong></summary>
        </br>

To run each test case class in the qgisfeed app:
```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec qgisfeed python qgisfeedproject/manage.py test qgisfeed.tests.QgisFeedEntryTestCase
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec qgisfeed python qgisfeedproject/manage.py test qgisfeed.tests.QgisUserVisitTestCase

```
</details>

## 🚀 Production Environment


<details>
    <summary><strong>⚙️ Production Environment Installation</strong></summary>
    </br>
For production, you can run this application with make commands or docker compose:

Docker configuration should be present in `.env` file in the main directory,
an example is provided in `env.template`:

```bash
# This file can be used as a template for .env
# The values in this file are also the default values.

# Host machine persistent storage directory, this path
# must be an existent directory with r/w permissions for
# the users from the Docker containers.
QGISFEED_DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME=/shared-volume

# Number of Gunicorn workers (usually: number of cores * 2 + 1)
QGISFEED_GUNICORN_WORKERS=4

# Database name
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBNAME=qgisfeed
# Database user
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBUSER=docker
# Database password
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBPASSWORD=docker
```

```bash
$ make start
```

A set of test data will be automatically loaded and the application will be available at http://localhost:80

To enter the control panel http://localhost:80/admin, two test users are available:

- Super Admin: the credentials are `admin`/`admin`
- Staff (News Entry Author): the credentials are `staff`/`staff`

### Enable SSL Certificate on production using Docker

1. Generate key using openssl in dhparam directory
```bash
openssl dhparam -out /home/web/qgis-feed/dhparam/dhparam-2048.pem 2048
```

2. Run the container
```bash
$ make start
```

3. Update `config/nginx/qgisfeed.conf` to include the new config file in `config/nginx/ssl/qgisfeed.conf`
```
include conf.d/ssl/*.conf;
```

4. Restart nginx service
```
nginx -s reload
```

5. To enable a cronjob to automatically renew ssl cert, add `scripts/renew_ssl.sh` to crontab file.

<details>
    <summary><strong>📧 Email-sending setup</strong></summary>
    </br>


- Generate the `.env` from `env.template` and edit it with the production email variables:
```sh
cp env.template .env
nano .env
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>🛠️ Troubleshooting SSL in production</strong></summary>
        </br>

Sometimes it seems our cron does not refresh the certificate. We can fix like this:

**Gentle Way**

```
ssh feed.qgis.org
cd /home/web/qgis-feed
scripts/renew_ssl.sh
```

Now check if your browser is showing the site opening with no SSL errors: https://feed.qgis.org

**More crude way**

```
ssh feed.qgis.org
cd /home/web/qgis-feed
make start c=certbot
make restart c=nginx
```

Now check if your browser is showing the site opening with no SSL errors: https://feed.qgis.org

## Backups

If something goes terribly wrong, we keep 7 nights of backups on hetzner and daily backups on a storage box.

If those are also not useful there are a collection of snapshot backups on hetzner and on a storage box

Last resort: Tim and Lova makes backups to his local machine on a semi-regular basis.
