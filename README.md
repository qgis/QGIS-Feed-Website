# QGIS Home Page News Feed

This application is the backend part that manages and serves news for the QGIS welcome page.


## Installation

- create a virtual env

    `$ virtualenv qgisfeedvenv`

- activate the virtual env:

    `$ source qgisfeedvenv/bin/activate`

- install dependencies:

    `$ pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`

- create a postgresql DB:

    `$ createdb qgisfeed`

- enable postgis:

    `$ psql qgisfeed -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;'`

- create `settings_local.py` and put your DB configuration as in the example below:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
            'NAME': 'qgisfeed',
            'USER': 'your_username',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432'
        }
    }
    ```

- run migrations, from the `qgisfeedproject` directory:

    `python manage.py migrate`

- create an admin user and set a password:

    `$ python manage.py createsuperuser`

- start the development server:

    `python manage.py runserver`

## Settings

To prevent DDOS attacks there is limit in the number of returned records (defaults to 20): it can be configured by overriding the settings in `settings_local.py` with:

```python
QGISFEED_MAX_RECORDS=40  # default value is 20
```

For email notifications, the sender address can be configured with:

```python
QGISFEED_FROM_EMAIL='noreply@qgis.org'`  # default value is 'noreply@qgis.org'
```

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/email/#module-django.core.mail for further email configuration.


## Control panel and permissions

Users with `staff` flag can enter the control panel at `/admin` and add feed entries, by default entries are not published.

Users with `superadmin` flag will be notified by email when an entry is added to the feed and will be able to publish the entry.

## Endpoint and accepted parameters

### Available parameters for filters

The following parameters can be passed by the client to filter available records.

Parameters are validated and in case they are not valid a `Bad Request` HTTP error code `400` is returned.

#### after

When `after` is passed, only the records that have been published after the given value will be returned.

Accepted values: unix timestamp (UTC)

Example call: http://localhost:8000/?after=1557419013


#### lang

When `lang` is passed, the records that have a different `lang` will be excluded from the results. Only the records with `null` `lang` and the records with a matching `lang` will be returned.

Accepted values: `ISO-939-1` two letters language code

Example call: http://localhost:8000/?lang=de

#### lat lon (location)

When `lat` **and** `lon` are passed, the records that have a location filter set will be returned only if the point defined by `lat` and `lon` is within record's location.

Accepted values: `ESPG:4326` latitude and longitude

Example call: http://localhost:8000/?lat=44.5&lon=9.23

## Runing test cases
Run test cases, from the `qgisfeedproject` directory:
You can run unit tests using the following comands:
### Run all tests
```sh
$ python manage.py test qgisfeed
```

### Run each test
```sh
$ python manage.py test qgisfeed.tests.QgisFeedEntryTestCase
$ python manage.py test qgisfeed.tests.QgisUserVisitTestCase
$ python manage.py test qgisfeed.tests.LoginTestCase
$ python manage.py test qgisfeed.tests.FeedsItemFormTestCase
$ python manage.py test qgisfeed.tests.FeedsListViewTestCase
```

### Run test with docker
If you are using docker, you can run tests by adding `docker-compose -f <docker-compose-file> exec <service-name>` before the command.
For example, to run login test case using docker-compose:
```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec qgisfeed python qgisfeedproject/manage.py test qgisfeed.tests.LoginTestCase 
```



## Docker for testing

For development purposes only, you can run this application in debug mode with docker compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

A set of test data will be automatically loaded and the application will be available at http://localhost:8000

To enter the control panel http://localhost:8000/admin, two test users are available:

- Super Admin: the credentials are `admin`/`admin`
- Staff (News Entry Author): the credentials are `staff`/`staff`

## Docker for production

For production, you can run this application  with docker compose:

Docker configuration should be present in `.env` file in the main directory,
an example is provided in `env.template`:

```bash
# This file can be used as a template for .env
# The values in this file are also the default values.

# Host machine persistent storage directory, this path
# must be an existent directory with r/w permissions for
# the users from the Docker containers.
QGISFEED_DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME=/shared-volume

# Number of Gunicorn workers (usually: number of cores * 2 + 1)
QGISFEED_GUNICORN_WORKERS=4

# Database name
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBNAME=qgisfeed
# Database user
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBUSER=docker
# Database password
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBPASSWORD=docker
```

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up
```

A set of test data will be automatically loaded and the application will be available at http://localhost:80

To enter the control panel http://localhost:80/admin, two test users are available:

- Super Admin: the credentials are `admin`/`admin`
- Staff (News Entry Author): the credentials are `staff`/`staff`

### Enable SSL Certificate on production using Docker

1. Generate key using openssl in dhparam directory
```bash
openssl dhparam -out /home/web/qgis-feed/dhparam/dhparam-2048.pem 2048
```

2. Run docker-compose using `docker-compose-production-ssl.yml`
```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-production-ssl.yml up
```

3. Update `config/nginx/qgisfeed.conf` to include the new config file in `config/nginx/ssl/qgisfeed.conf`
```
include conf.d/ssl/*.conf;
```

4. Restart nginx service
```
nginx -s reload
```

5. To enable a cronjob to automatically renew ssl cert, add `scripts/renew_ssl.sh` to crontab file.


## Troubleshooting SSL in production

Sometimes it seems our cron does not refresh the certificate. We can fix like this:

**Gentle Way**

```
ssh feed.qgis.org
cd /home/web/qgis-feed
scripts/renew_ssl.sh
```

Now check if your browser is showing the site opening with no SSL errors: https://feed.qgis.org

**More crude way**

```
ssh feed.qgis.org
cd /home/web/qgis-feed
docker-compose -f docker-compose-production-ssl.yml up certbot
docker-compose -f docker-compose-production-ssl.yml restart nginx
```

Now check if your browser is showing the site opening with no SSL errors: https://feed.qgis.org

## Backups

If something goes terribly wrong, we keep 7 nights of backups on hetzner

If those are also not useful there are a collection of snapshot backups on hetzner

Last resort: Tim makes backups to his local machine on a semi-regular basis.

## Deploying on Rancher

This repository contains a rancher template directory (the ``template`` folder in the root of the repo)
which can be used to deploy this site onto a host using [Rancher](https://rancher.com). Currently ony Rancher v1.6 
(i.e. not v2) is supported.

This guide serves as a quick setup guide to spin up a one of our Rancher catalogue packages.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that the following steps have been done:

1. **Install Docker:** Docker is installed on your server. Use Ubuntu 16.04 for the best results
because that is what we are testing on. For quick installation, use the
[convenience scripts](http://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/hosts/#supported-docker-versions)
provided by Rancher (make sure you choose a supported version).


2. **Install Rancher:** The **stable** version of Rancher v1 Server has been set up.

If it's not, refer to [Rancher quickstart
guide](http://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/installing-rancher/installing-server/).
Here is an example of how to run the latest stable release with a persistent
mysql database stored on the file system:

```
mkdir /home/mysql
docker run -d -v /home/mysql:/var/lib/mysql --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 rancher/server:stable
```

3. **Create an environment:** Once rancher server has been set up. Create an
environment. You can create an Rancher environment ``<rancher
url>/settings/env/add``.

4. **Set up the Hetzner Machine Driver**: This only applies if you are using
Hetzner Cloud as your hosting provider. You can automatically manage and deploy
hosts on Hetzner using the Admin -> Machine Drivers menu and then enable the
Hetzner driver.  

5. **Add a host:** You need to add a host to the environment has been set up to
actually run the instance (the agent could be on the same host as the rancher
server but it is not recommended). You can do this by ensuring your chosen
environment is active and then from the menu do ``Environment -> Hosts``. If you
running on hetzner cloud, choose the Hetzner machine driver and then enter the
API key for your Hetzner Cloud project (you can get this key from the Hetzner
Cloud admin ui). Alternatively manually set up a linux host with docker on it
and then use the manual host setup as directed by the ``Infrastructure -> Hosts
-> Add Host`` page in Rancher. The process is quite logical and simple and
involves pasting a single line of code onto the host that will run the agent.
Once the host is set up with a running agent, you should see it join the
environment as shown below:

6. ** Installing from the catalogue:** Once Rancher is installed, your
environment and host are set up, use the Admin -> Settings menu to add our
Rancher catalogue using this URL:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed

Once your settings are saved open a Rancher environment and set up a 
stack from the catalogue's 'QGIS' section - you will see 
QGIS-Feed listed there.


Now you can add items from the QGIS catalogue to your stack.
